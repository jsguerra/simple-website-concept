            <p>Although, this website has a focus on a specific lineage, it provides broard information for members of any other descendancy to research their past.</p>
            <p>The Guerra surname has a long history dating back to origins in Portugal and Spain. However, the bulk of the research provided on this website deals with the Guerra family origins from the 1600's in New Spain, later Mexico. Many members of the Guerra family in Northern Mexico and Southern Texas can trace their origins back to one specific ancestor, Ignacio Guerra Cañamar.</p>
            <p>Ignacio Guerra Cañamar was born in Mexico City on the 6th of November 1633. Many of his descendants still live in and around the regions where he once lived. The family Guerra crest to the left is a representation of Ignacio Guerra's crest, a tower on fire with the words "Ave Maria".</p>
